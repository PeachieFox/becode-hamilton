## Pascal Georges

<p>Passionate about illustration, animation and programming, fields that allow me to combine creativity and technique. My interest is particularly in 2D and 3D character animation, as well as video game development. I have a constant desire to learn new techniques to refine my skills and bring ever more captivating projects to life. I dream of thriving in an environment where I could create unique visual worlds, while taking on stimulating challenges. Each project is an opportunity to learn, innovate and express my passion on a daily basis.</p>
<p>As part of web development, I make it a point of honor to optimize my projects for SEO and responsive design. It was with the aim of improving my productions that I started to study the Bootstrap framework as well as various other JS frameworks.</p>
